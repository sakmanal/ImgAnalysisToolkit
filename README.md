# ImgAnalysisToolkit

This project is a client side Image Analysis Toolkit for text document Binarization & Segmentation written in TypeScript. 

Demo: (https://athanasios.netlify.app)

### Binarization

Implements Otsu [1], Sauvola [2] and GPP [3] Binarization methods for modern/degraded documents.

### Segmentation

Implements Text Segmentation method for modern/historical machine-printed documents based on ARLSA [4].
